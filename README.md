# Depression & Anxiety Detection Using Multimodal Data 

This repository supports the paper: > **A Multimodal Sensor Fusion Approach Using Mobile, Wearable, and
IoT Sensors for Mental Health Detection**

We present a machine learning and deep learning framework that uses multimodal data collected from **mobile**, **wearable deivices**, and **home IoT sensors** to detect signs of **depression and anxiety** in real-world environments.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

We provide extracted and preprocessed features (in ML models/FEATURES or DL models/FEATURES) to support reproducibility.

🔒 The raw data (from mobile, wearable, and IoT sensors) is not publicly released due to privacy concerns.
